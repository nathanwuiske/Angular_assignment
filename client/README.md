# Code_Challenge_Urpla

1. Using Angular 9 (and any other dependencies) to create 2 pages. The first page should list all heroes with basic information and the second should take you to the details of a single hero. We want to see how you would structure your code and use the API to retrieve data. 

2. Using Puppeteer (or any other tools to crawl websites) get a list of at least 12 heroes with basic information about them (name, photo, bio). Store the data locally so it can be served to your Angular application

3. Use Node.JS/Express along with the Serverless framework on the backend to expose a series of API's to return the data captured by your crawler in step 2

4. Bonus - since this is your first assignment at HeroDB, devise an extra killer feature that you think your supervisors at HeroDB would really enjoy.

5. Finally, deploy your application to AWS or other PAAS (free tier). Send us a fork of this repo or a zip of your source code and a link to your deployed application.
